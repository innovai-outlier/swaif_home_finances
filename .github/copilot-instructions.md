# Copilot Instructions (Spec-Driven Development)

You must follow Spec Kit SDD and this repo’s constitution.

## Required reading order
1) `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
2) For the active feature: `specs/<feature>/spec.md` then `plan.md` then `tasks.md`

## Phase rules
- Do NOT propose implementation changes unless `tasks.md` exists and the feature is approved.
- If requirements are unclear, update `spec.md` with **Open Questions** instead of guessing.
- Any code suggestion must reference which task(s) it satisfies.

## Output discipline
- Prefer updating spec artifacts over writing code when artifacts are missing/incomplete.
- Keep changes small and traceable.
