# Codex Bootstrap Prompt (paste into Codex chat)

Read and obey `AGENTS.md` at repo root.

Now do this:
1) Read:
   - `specs/<FEATURE>/spec.md`
   - `specs/<FEATURE>/plan.md`
   - `specs/<FEATURE>/tasks.md`
2) Implement ONLY tasks 1–3 from `tasks.md` (first three unchecked items).
3) Run lint/tests (use the commands in `AGENTS.md`; if placeholders exist, ask for the correct commands before running).
4) Report:
   - which tasks were completed
   - files changed
   - validation commands + expected output
5) If any task is ambiguous, STOP and propose a clarification update to `tasks.md` (do not guess).
