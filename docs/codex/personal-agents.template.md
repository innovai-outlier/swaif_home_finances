# Optional: Personal Codex Defaults (global)
Save as: ~/.codex/AGENTS.md

Use this if you want Codex to follow consistent personal defaults across all repos.
Example rules you may want:

- Always run unit tests after editing backend code.
- Always run lint/format before finalizing changes.
- Ask before adding dependencies.
- Prefer minimal diffs; do not refactor unless required by tasks.
- Never print secrets or sensitive data.

(Keep this file short and stable. Repo-level AGENTS.md should override project specifics.)
